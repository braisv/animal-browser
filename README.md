# Animal browser

_Simple application based on React JS framework, with typescript and sass_



## Instalation ðŸ”§

Install all the dependencies with thw following command on you terminal:

```
npm i
```

## Deploy ðŸ“¦

I used _esbuild_ bundler to improve performance and fast builds. You can create a new build and deploy the app with the following command:

```
npm run build
```

Or you can simply deploy the app with:

```
npm start
```
